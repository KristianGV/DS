\section{Cosmic Rays -- auxiliary routines}

This folder contains auxiliary functions needed by the cosmic ray routines. In particular,
it contains different versions of simple integration routines and a set of routines
to handle the correct setting and interpreting of labels for the tabulation of confinement times
and Green's functions needed for the calculation of cosmic ray fluxes.
