\section{Neutrino fluxes from the halo -- theory}


Usually, the flux of neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs in
the Milky Way halo is too small to be detectable, but for some clumpy
or cuspy models, it might be detectable. The calculation of the
neutrino-flux follows closely the calculation of the continuous gamma
ray flux, with the main addition that neutrino interactions close to
the detector are also included. Hence, both the neutrino flux and the
neutrino-induced muon flux can be obtained. The neutrino to muon
conversion rate in the Earth can also be obtained.
