\section{Sun and Earth models -- theory}


We need to have accurate models for the Sun and the Earth, both in terms of mass distributions, but also in terms chemical compositions etc. We here include
a set of Sun and Earth models.

The models here are used for the capture rate calculation for capture of WIMPs in the Sun and the Earth, but they are also used for external packages like \ftb{WimpSim} which simulates neutrino interactions and oscillations on the way out of the Sun/Earth. Those simulation results are included as tables in \texttt{se\_yield}.
