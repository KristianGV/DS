In the folder \code{src/dmd\_astro} we provide a set of wrapper
routines that all call the halo driver function \code{dsdmsdriver} in 
a specific way. The rest of the code communicates with \code{dsdmsdriver},
and hence the halo model(s), only via these functions and never by 
calling \code{dsdmsdriver} directly. The routines in  \code{src/dmd\_astro} 
therefore provide examples of functions that {\it cannot be
replaced} individually in a consistent way, but only as a whole set 
(along with \code{dsdmsdriver},
in case the user wants to change the structure of the driver itself).
