\section{XDIAG}

This folder contains a set of routines to perform numerical
diagonalization of complex matrices. Even though analytical routines can be
used for up to $5 \times 5$ matrics, they tend to be numerically unstable for
matrices occuring in some particle physics models (for example supersymmetry).
Hence, we use numerical routines to perform the diagonalization instead.
