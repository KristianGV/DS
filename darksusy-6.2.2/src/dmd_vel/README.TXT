NOTE. This directory should be killed at some point.
The hm stuff here is only used for velocity distributions, the other
parts are set in dmd_mod. The velocity distributions should in principle
go into dmd_mod as well, but should preferably do so when they are cleaned
up and/or merged with the dsdmsdriver functionality.

The other routines here, like dsnewdms, will probably be made obsolete
once the new label transferring to the cr_* routines is working.
