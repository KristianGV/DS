\chapter{The empty model}

The empty module cannot be used to perform any real calculations. Its purpose is for debugging
and testing only, with the main advantage being that it contains (empty versions of) all interface 
functions that the core library is aware of (for a full list, see Table \ref{tab:if}). In some cases, this 
makes it a good starting point to create new particle physics modules.
