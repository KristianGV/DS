\label{ch:vdSIDM_cr}

The cosmic-ray source functions in \code{vdSIDM} simply return zero, as there are currently no 
couplings to SM particles implemented. In a future version of the code, the user will be able to
add partial widths of the mediator particles to visible channels. The  cosmic-ray source functions
\code{dscrsource} and \code{dscrsource\_line} will then be correspondingly updated.
