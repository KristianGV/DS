\label{ch:vdSIDM_ini}

Currently, the 
module has two concrete example models fully implemented, where DM is a massive Dirac fermion
$\psi_\chi$, DR is a massless fermion $\psi_{\tilde \gamma}$, and the mediator is either a vector $V$
or a scalar $\phi$. The interaction parts of the respective
Lagrangians are thus given by 
\bea
\label{sidm_vector}
\Delta \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{vector}& =&  g_\chi \bar\psi_{\chi} \slashed{V} \psi_{\chi}+g_{\tilde \gamma} \bar\psi_{\tilde \gamma} \slashed{V} \psi_{\tilde \gamma}
\eea
and
\bea
\label{sidm_scalar}
\Delta \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{scalar}& =&   g_\chi \bar\psi_\chi \psi_\chi \phi +g_{\tilde \gamma} \bar\psi_{\tilde \gamma} \psi_{\tilde \gamma} \phi \,.
\eea
Calling \code{dsgivemodel\_vdSIDM\_vector} or \code{dsgivemodel\_vdSIDM\_scalar} sets the
DM mass, mediator mass  and couplings for these models after which, as usual, the model is set up by 
a call to \code{dsmodelsetup}. This routine calculates for example the total decay width of the mediator, for which we add
the contributions from decay to DR and (for heavy mediators, if kinematically allowed) decay into DM particles.
