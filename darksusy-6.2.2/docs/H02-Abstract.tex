\ds\ is a package for numerical dark matter calculations including, but
not limited to, supersymmetric dark matter. 
This manual describes the theoretical background as well as details about
the actual routines. Everything is not covered, but it should hopefully
prove useful if you need more information than in our published articles.

We try to keep it clear and up-to-date with the code, but there will be
cases where changes/improvements in the code, for one reason or another,
will not have propagated into the manual. Hence, check the actual code
if you want to be certain about how a given process/feature is implemented.
