The general procedure to get isajet (or really isasugra) for DarkSUSY is:

* Download isajet from
  http://www.hep.fsu.edu/~isajet/

* As of version 7.87 it is now distributed as a tar file. Unpack it in
  contrib/isajet-<version>-for-darksusy and delete
  isared (as we don't need it for DarkSUSY).

* NOTICE: for compatibility with gfortran, change 'BLOCK DATA' to
  'SUBROUTINE' in aldata.f. You may need to make the file write-able
  as the files by default are read-only.

* Rename the common block SEED in isainc/seed.inc to e.g. SEEDg as the
  SEED common block is in conflict with other codes when using with gambit.
  (Change SEED to SEEDg also in ranfgt.f and ranfst.f-should not be needed)

* rename Makefile to makefile.in and modify it to set compiler and
  compiler options from DS configure

* Modify isajet/Makefile to make it build a shared library as well

* Check that the interface in src_models/mssm/ge_cmssm is OK with the new
  version (.e.g. that the common blocks are defined correctly in
  src_models/mssm/include/dsisasugra.h).

* Try to compile dsmain_wimp.f with this new version and run it for a cMSSM
  model. If it works, everything is fine. However, there may be some more
  of the small files that are needed. Then add them and try again.
