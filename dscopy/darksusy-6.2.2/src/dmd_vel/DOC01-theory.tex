\section{Dark matter phase-space distributions -- theory}
\label{sec:dmd_vel}

The DM velocity and density profiles cannot be chosen independently,
in principle, but have to satisfy consistency relations. For 
a spherically symmetric and isotropic system, e.g., the two profiles are related by the 
Eddington equation \cite{1915MNRAS..76...37E,Catena:2011kv}. A fully self-consistent 
implementation of phase-space distributions will be available with a later \ds\ version,
at which point the directory \code{dmd\_vel} will become obsolete. 

Until then, the user can freely choose a DM velocity distribution among those provided in 
\code{src/dmd\_vel} -- but should keep in mind this consistency requirement 
when comparing direct detection rates (which require the local DM velocity profile) to, e.g., 
the gamma-ray flux from the galactic center 
(which requires choosing a density profile). Concretely, it is the function \code{dshmuDF}
that returns the 3D distribution function $f(\mathbf{v})$ needed by the direct detection routines. 
It allows to switch between various pre-implemented functional forms, including tabulated
velocity profiles, but can of course also be replaced by an arbitrary function supplied by the user
(c.f.~Section \ref{sec:replaceable}).
 

One of these options is the often adopted truncated gaussian, which in the detector frame 
moving at
speed $v_O$ relative to the galactic halo reads
\begin{equation}
   f(v) = {1\over {\mathcal N}_{\rm cut}} { v^2 \over u v_O \sigma} \left\{
   \exp\left[{-{(u-v_O)^2\over2\sigma^2}}\right] -
   \exp\left[{-{\min(u+v_O,v_{\rm cut})^2\over2\sigma^2}}\right]
   \right\}
\end{equation}
for $ v_{\rm esc} < v < \sqrt{v_{\rm esc}^2 + (v_O + v_{\rm cut} ) ^2
} $ and zero otherwise, with $ u = \sqrt{v^2 + v_{\rm esc}^2} $ and
\begin{equation}
   {\mathcal N}_{\rm cut} =
   {v_{\rm cut}\over\sigma} \exp\left( {-{v_{\rm cut}^2\over2\sigma^2}} \right)
   -
   \sqrt{\pi\over2} {\rm erf} \left( {v_{\rm cut}\over\sqrt{2}\sigma} \right) .
\end{equation}
As default, we have taken the halo line-of-sight (one-dimensional) velocity
dispersion $\sigma = $120 km/s,\footnote{Other authors write
   $\exp(-3v^2/2\overline{v}^2)$, in which case $\overline{v} = \sqrt{3}
   \sigma$.}  the galactic escape speed $ v_{\rm cut} = $ 600 km/s, the relative
Earth-halo speed $ v_O = $ 264 km/s (a yearly average) and the Earth escape
speed $ v_{\rm esc} = $ 11.9 km/s. These parameters can be changed by
the user.
