\chapter{Self-Interacting Dark Matter}
\label{ch:vdSIDM}

The \code{vdSIDM} module implements a simplified model setup where DM is confined to a dark sector
without (direct) interactions with the standard model. Besides the DM particle, which is assumed to be non-relativistic,
there is also a dark radiation (DR) particle which in general will contribute to the relativistic degrees of freedom
in the universe -- a quantity which is conventionally stated in terms of the contribution from a single neutrino
species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, and which is tightly constrained by both BBN and CMB. 
Finally, the module implements a mediator particle. In principle, the code structure is set up such that arbitrary 
spin combinations of these three particles can be implemented, but presently only scalar and vector mediators
(for Dirac DM and DR) are available.  If the mass of the mediator particle is much lighter than the DM mass,
the resulting Yukawa potential between DM particles results in a self-scattering rate that is strongly velocity-dependent
-- as indicated in the name of the module.
