\chapter{Generic decaying dark matter}
\label{ch:decay}

This module provides a simple phenomenological template 
for a generic decaying dark matter model. It is fully specified by
the DM mass $m_\chi$ and the total decay rate $\Gamma$, 
along with a list of decay channels. The latter are specified by their
branching ratios and the PDG codes of the final state standard 
model particles. Non-standard model final states can
also be included, and are treated as invisible decays.

The phenomenology of this module is restricted to indirect 
DM searches, with full access to the corresponding routines 
in \code{ds\_core}. DM scattering with nuclei is assumed to be 
negligible, as well thermal production of DM in the early universe.
