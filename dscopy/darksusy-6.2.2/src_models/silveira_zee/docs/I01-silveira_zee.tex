\chapter{Silveira-Zee (Scalar Singlet)}

The module \code{silveira\_zee} implements the scalar singlet DM model of Silveira and 
Zee \cite{Silveira:1985rk}, also referred to as `scalar phantoms' (which is the original name 
in \cite{Silveira:1985rk}) and `singlet Higgs DM'.  
This model adds a gauge-singlet real scalar field $S$ to the standard 
model, with imposed $Z_2$ symmetry $S\to -S$. Its Lagrangian is
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}_{\rm SZ} = {\cal L}_{\rm SM} + \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu S \partial^\mu S - \frac{1}{2} \mu^2 S^2 - \frac{1}{2} \lambda S^2 H^\dagger H,
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Standard Model Higgs doublet. After electroweak symmetry breaking, the $S$ boson 
acquires a tree-level mass
\begin{equation}
m_S = \sqrt{\mu^2 + \frac{1}{2} \lambda v_0^2}\,,
\end{equation}
where $v_0=(\sqrt{2} G_F)^{-1/2}=246.2$~GeV is the Higgs vacuum expectation value.
The module uses the $S$ mass $m_S$ and the $S$-Higgs coupling constant 
$\lambda$ as model parameters. These parameters are set with a call to
\code{dsgivemodel\_silveira\_zee}, followed as usual by a call to \code{dsmodelsetup}
to initialize the model for use with \ds.
