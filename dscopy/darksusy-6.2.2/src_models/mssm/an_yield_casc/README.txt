This folder is for cascade decays of particles like Higgses and the routines
calculate the yields from these decays. These routines were earlier a part
of the ha routines, but as the avaialble cascade decays are model dependent,
they are instead moved here. The actual simulation data are in src/an_yields
(only contains simulated channels). 

At some point, we might be able to make also these parts model independent at
which point they can move into src/ as well.
