# This file includes the directories in src/, which should be searched
# by the script headers2tex.pl. The script will look in these directories
# for documentation tex-files and for headers in the Fortran routines.
#
# The format below is that each directory resides on one row with the first
# element being the directory name and the rest being the title
# of that chapter as it will appear in the manual. The order in which 
# the directories appear below is the order in which the chapters/sections will
# appear in the manual. Note that for particle physics modules, the first entry
# should be to the subdirectory docs where general text and documentation 
# about the model should be given.
